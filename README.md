Hello folks!

In this project i learned how to create a Webpage using only html.
Linking to my own directories via <a href> and setting up images via <img>.
Also listing via and unordered and ordered list <ul>/<ol>.

Outside of that i also learned how to setup a repository in GitHub, and add/commit/push to it.
